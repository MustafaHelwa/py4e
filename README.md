In this repository, I will file my work along the jurney in [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python). 

Each course assignments and quizzes will be recorded in a course folder and it will be named by the week number. 
You can use it as a reference to help you in solving your problems.

Please note that both the 1st and the 2nd courses assignments will run using Python Code Playground provided by course instructors. While the rest will be operated using text editors and/or IDEs.

Goodluck!!
